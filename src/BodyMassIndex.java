//Making a Difference
//        2.33 (Body Mass Index Calculator) We introduced the body mass index (BMI) calculator in
//        Exercise 1.10. The formulas for calculating BMI are

//BMI weightInPounds × 703
//        heightInInches × heightInInches
//        = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//Create a BMI calculator that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if you prefer,
//        the user’s weight in kilograms and height in meters), then calculates and displays the user’s
//        body mass index. Also, display the BMI categories and their values from the National Heart Lung
//        and Blood Institute
//        http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm
//        so the user can evaluate his/her BMI.
//        [Note: In this chapter, you learned to use the int type to represent whole numbers. The BMI
//        calculations when done with int values will both produce whole-number results. In Chapter 3
//        you’ll learn to use the double type to represent numbers with decimal points. When the BMI calculations
//        are performed with doubles, they’ll both produce numbers with decimal points—these
//        are called “floating-point” numbers.]
